If you ring their NZ contact number
If you ring their NZ contact number, it is deregistered. Google the address and it is a post office which scans back to head office in Kuwait.

Unlike Amazon, you can not return goods. Their goods are suited to some countries but may not be used or suitable for the NZ market.

Shop with great caution

The process was simple and had good feedback from local representative in KSA.
However, it took longer than expected to get the delivery probably due to Fedex procedures.
Anyway, as far as the Ubuy's local representative are alert and responsible I feel very secure while ordering online thru Ubuy.

Shipping charges are ridiculous!
The company has great products, however they are extremely overpriced in their shipping charges! I placed an order in May and the invoice stated $92.61 and I was charged over $200.00! Based on this alone I will not order from them again. There is absolutely no need to over charge customers like that, duties are not twice the amount of the products purchased!

I would leave zero score but dont have option to do so. I have ordered on 3 separate occasions from ubuy Saudi website items which they claim to have for sale to be shipped from the US. Each time the have failed to honour the sale. They seem to advertise alot of expensive items which they will never sell or have no interest in selling. Appears to be a scam and they take payment and hold onto it for as long as they can. I will never buy from such a rubbish company again. Best option stick to the proper online companies like aliexpress and Amazon.

The good :
I like their boxes .
The bad :I made an order and it showed it would arrive in two parcels . The first one came with a missing item . I informed ubuy who told me to wait. When the second parcel arrived , I contacted ubuy about the missing item . They told me I need to send them a photo of box and the invoice in the box both of which I had thrown out a few hours before this review . UBUY agents told me it is their policy and don't get why am upset that the first agent failed to inform me of the Policy

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with , they don’t worry about customer satisfaction but only care about taking their money ! I have been deceived twice now and could not even get my items changed? I didn’t want even my money back but they never even listened to my complaint !
Don’t support this company, I wish for no customer to be treated unfairly and with disrespect. They are extremely unprofessional and have hidden agendas to cripple the customer and basically once you paid them you can kiss goodbye to your cash!!
I don’t know how they can still run a scam such as this and claim that they successful, yes, most reviews are auto generated and false !!!!
Lastly, don’t fall for their trap and please pass on the message that they aren’t to be trusted in anyway whatsoever!!!

The biggest scam of the millennium and nobody is noticing.

I have read numerous reviews before buying and decided to test them out with a smallish purchase. Although I had to inquire about the delivery date, after I received immediate feedback, everything happened very quickly. The consultant kept informing me about progress and the package was delivered to me without any further issues. I will be ordering from Ubuy again.

I received a delivery in November goods damaged
I received a delivery in November of a Swan Retro Microwave in Orange from UBuy Dubai. Unfortunately, it was delivered with a large scratch across the silver door handle. I meant to call ask for it to be replaced and every time I look at it I think 'must remember to call UBUY'.

However never got around it but yesterday was reminded of this as I received a delivery from DesertCart of a Swan Orange Retro kettle and toaster in perfect condition. I contacted Ubuy to see if they could replace my microwave as I know it is under a manufacturer warranty for a year and they refused. Rahul was the person I chatted to. Very unhelpful.

DO NOT TRUST UBUY
DO NOT TRUST UBUY.
We bought 3 items, 2 were only supplied. UBUY's conditions stated that any goods not supplied will receive a refund. That never happened. When we opened a case with PayPal and provided UBUY's own documents and invoice to support our case, PayPal denied our claim for the missing item and screwed us big time. UBUY did nothing to defend themselves or provide hard evidence and we lost our claim.
Ubuy know all the tricks, excuses to pass any refund obligations and be able to charge more for less products shipped.
Robbed once by UBUY then again by PayPal.
Stay clear of both these thieves!

Awful company. Good if youre in the middle east. Rubbish anywhere else. Im in Asia and spent 2 days on the phone to my bank to get a Visa card payment authorised. My bank authorised payment but Ubuy cancelled as I was asking for delivery to Asia and not the UK where my card was registered. Came up 'Failed transaction' on Ubuy website BUT THE MONEY WAS STILL DEBITED from my account. I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and my bank said 'they can still take the money for an indefinite period....we have to honour visa payments'. The shipping costs were nearly a quarter of the total payment as well. AVOID THIS COMPANY

DECEIVING PRICE, TERRIBLE SERVICE, be really careful.
you will be cheated by this website.

I bought one pack of Tassimo Jacobs Caff serveral weeks ago. i live in Belgium now?i tried to buy it through amzon.de, but self-opretated product by amzon.de can not be delivered to Belgium, i have to pay the delivery fees if i bought it from individual seller. I thought maybe there are some cheaper online shop.

So i searched for "coffe be", then the ubuy.be jumped out, i thought it is a professional online shpping website for Belgians (forgive me, i am not locals, i am not familar with online shopping here in Belgium) the price showed on the website is really cheap, 13 to 18 euros. BUT IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE. If you proceed to pay, you will have two options, for example, the 13 euro coffee, with the express delivery, you need to pay 25.20 euro, normal delivery 17.10, that is still acceptable. BUT IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE. if you continue the payment, you will find you lost more than 40 euros!!!

After i checked my bank account, i found it was deducted more than 40 euros, then i contacted with the official email address. i really want to use bad language here!!!! i sent them aroung 10 emails asked them to cancel my order, they just told you please wait, please wait, they did not do anything. i still have all the documents with me.

I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, BE CAREFUL WITH PRICE, IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE, AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL IF YOU HAVE PAID. BE CAREFUL!! DECEIVING WEBSITE! IF YOU DO NOT PAY ATTENTION, YOU WLL NEVER NOTICE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE PAID!!!!

A complete waste of time
A complete waste of time. My dad made a lay buy order with them for a product that he was told (and is also stated on his contract) he would receive automatically after 14 payments. 17 payments later i was worried he was being scammed after receiving nothing so I called in on his behalf and was told that we were actually supposed to call Ubuy ourselves after 10 weeks of payments in order to send our shipment to our address and that we should now receive it within 2 weeks from that day of the call, they also told me to call in a week and a half to check up on the shipment which I did. The salesman who originally spoke to my dad at the time of purchase did not mention anything about having to call in or anything. When i called in a week and a half later they proceeded to tell me that the shipment was never sent out because they are out of stock of the product that my dad purchased and that they have no idea on a time frame on when stock would come into store! My dad has now paid around $600 to Ubuy at this point and had only received a useless and cheap "free with purchase" mobile phone that malfunctioned 2 weeks after it arrived. I asked if there was anyway to refund the entire purchase and all money my dad had already paid which they said is possible but will include a $150 cancellation fee???!!! RIDICULOUS. We are still unaware of when exactly we will receive the product we were promised to have weeks ago. I wish i could've advised my dad against this purchase almost 5 months ago now.

I'd highly recommend to not ever buy through this company, they have poor communication and made lots of unfulfilled promises to us. Customer service was also very unhelpful and contradicted each other. Very disappointing UBuy!

While they may have good communication during the buying process they will not take responsibility beyond 5 days for faulty products and you will be fobbed off onto the manufacturer. They also advertise American goods which do not have the right plug/voltage for other countries even though they advertise using a local domain name. They also do not operate with a secure domain so your payment information may not be secure. Don't be fooled by their claim they care about customer satisfaction. It is a lie.

Best Customer Service by far for online shopping
I had a superb experience with UBUY, they have great products and amazing over the top customer service. Even I feel 5 stars is not enough to justify the great customer service, from UBUY to solve any issue relating to purchase and products. I was very happy with my purchase and will definitely use UBUY again. best part about UBUY is that you have immediate response from customer service if there are any issues with your purchases. Also to mention the charger I purchase is 100% genuine product as advertised. One of best online stores and great online shopping experience.

BUYERS BEWARE UBUY IS A BADBUY
BUYERS BEWARE, UBUY IS A BADBUY
My order and payment was accepted immediately only to be cancelled 24 hours later. Refund only in 7 days. I will potentially suffer loss due to currency fluctuations. No indication by UBUY was given that the product can not be sold or shipped to RSA. This constitutes misrepresentation and Breach of agreement( not to mention Trust).

I ordered product on Ubuy.ae and it arrived not in working condition! when I requested for refund, they asked me to send many times videos that device is really not in working condition. After 3 weeks only I received a reply that they cannot refund me the full amount for my device. It's very disappointing and poor return service and I will not advice Ubuy.ae to anyone.

Well priced items, terrible return/refund policy!
The products were a great price, the delivery was quite expensive, but it was to a different country and for some moderately heavy items. The delivery time was very quick, but as i was away i didnt check the items fully for a week after delivery. I then found that one of the items didnt work properly and so contacted ubuy to be told within 10 minutes of messaging them (so quick customer service) that they have a 5 day contact them policy, anything after this period is not their problem! Quite unreasonable for online items that you have paid a lot of money for! Id be wary of using them again and buy local from a store instead.

Ordered a Littmann Stethescope from Ubuy. I paid using credit card and the amount (AED 992) was promptly deducted. After 2 days i received an email stating that the item is no more in stock and that my order has been cancelled and assured that the amount will be returned within a week or so. The amount was never credited back and after almost a full year of e-mails to Ubuy support and also to my bank finally i left the issue and i lost the money. I think this website is a Scam.

Payment via Paypal
Placed an order today tried using credit card but the site kept giving error on card number, clicked on Paypal option using the same card number and payment went through. To my horror even though I purchased goods in South Africa for a South African value they processed this in USD, there is admittedly a note saying Paypal will be USD but you get no notification of what the USD value is until your card is debited for a huge amount. Total rip off. Don't aver accept payment via Paypal assuming you are paying fair price in the currency you have agreed to.

Dear Merlys Cheng,

Greetings from Ubuy!

We would like to inform you that you have ordered an electronic item from our US store and we have notified that it will work on 110V and you will have to use a step-down power converter.
But after checking the video you provided, we saw that you didn't use the power converter and that caused the item damage.
Hence, your issue was closed further.

Thank you!

Dear Peter Rehnke,

Greetings from Ubuy!

We apologies for the inconvenience caused to you. Further, we have checked and found that our executive did inform you that your amount will be reversed back to you since Ubuy never received the amount for your transaction. It was put on hold by payment gateway and they were unable to authenticate the transaction. You will surely receive the Credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer’s policies.

For more information, you can contact with payment gateway team at https://www.cybersource.com/about/contact_us/

No customer service - Unethical conduct of business
Try to buy what you are looking for some place else. The way these people conduct business is unacceptable and the customer service will not help you. I placed the wrong order and canceled it. It hadn't been shipped out yet but still I had to pay for the shipping charges. This is the last email I sent them after they apologized;

" No worries.

I'll simply make sure to leave an honest review about how you do business. Not even sending me a verification email about my order after I've placed it (which is very odd). It's a universal rule that an email is automatically sent when you order something, so that one knows that the order has successfully been placed. Therefore I have no way of verifying how much you are deducting (which is uncomfortable). This is a very ugly way of doing business. The costumer should be informed especially when you have taken the time to withdraw money from one's account (which I never was - no info at all). Don't call this customer service because it's not. You did nothing to help me. Simply went on to tell me about how you successfully did nothing.

Kind regards "

They wrote it's 10 working days and I'll receive it by 11 January.!

Ubuy is the best! Im situated in South Africa and it was the first time I order from a company abroad. They assisted me from the start till the end. I received a broken item, customs in South Africa most probably broke an item in my order. Ubuy refunded me the item within days and I reordered the item. I received it in perfect condition after floating around during Christmas time in the airports.
I want to thank Ubuy for their excellent service every step of the way.

UBUY - TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
Let me start off by saying this, this is the second time that I post this review. Ubuy agent: "I am still waiting for your confirmation on removing the review as it has still not been removed." Ubuy has been nothing but misleading, unresponsive, unreasonable, unreliable, and CONSTANTLY ASKING ME TO REMOVE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW.

Terrible experience with Ubuy. The product I ordered sits on my desk catching dust as I have yet to open it. I placed an order and paid an unreasonable amount for express shipping to expedite and receive the order on time for an event. The 3-6 business days for expedited delivery apparently means nothing to them as I received my product way after the given date. I pay a large sum of money to expedite in 3-6 business days and receive it in 10 business days? It does not matter if it is not fulfilled by Ubuy and will take a minimum of 10 business days, what matters is that if you include that as an option you need to be able to DELIVER. After being promised a proper refund (in Credits), I was told to take down my review with no valid reason, and after I do so, in return I was only refunded a mere fraction of what I should receive!! Ubuy is by far the worst online platform that I have ever dealt with, their customer support does nothing even when they know they are in the wrong. Ubuy needs to understand that when a customer places an order to expedite it and receive it as soon as possible they should receive it on time. DO NOT include the option of express shipping if you will deliver it past the deadline. The purpose of ordering online is for convenience, and with this experience, and with Ubuy it has been far from convenient.

My advice to Ubuy; How can a consumer trust your services if you are misleading. Most importantly, you need to be much more consumer oriented. A company should never ask a customer to take down their review. Especially when it is their fault they should at least provide reasonable compensation, reasoning, and realize that THEY ARE WRONG, and instead of asking to take down the review the customer will naturally do so.

Outrages Courier Fees
Wanted to buy a pram, cost was R1095 BUT shipping is R11995. That's just stupid... They shouldn't list items with such ridiculous courier fees.

Well
Well , products are very expensive according to other sites . For example , i wanted to purchase Juvias place makeup masquerade eyeshadow palette , it costs 41 $ on ubuy site + shipping fees so let's say will gonna pay about 100 $ lol so ridiculous guys... Let me tell u that on juvias site this palette costs 25$ only . So i will order it for sure from their site not ubuy .

I bought two pairs of Geox shoes on the site. The price was quoted clearly on the site and the total shown in the basket was exactly correct. However when I proceeded to the payment section the price changed considerably and I was forced to pay much more for the shoes or to abort the purchase. This is highly unethical and I was caught in a dilemma, but because I needed the shoes I proceeded and paid the higher price. (Please note that I am not referring to the courier charge which was quoted separately,) The actual delivery of the shoes all proceeded fine and they were delivered intact within a reasonable time.

I would like in future to be able to use the site, but cannot unless they rectify the situation such that the price quoted is the price that you pay.

Really bad experience, stay away from them
Really bad experience with trying to get a faulty electric appliance returned or repaired. The product did not work straight out of the box, but I only opened the box to check a week after it was delivered. They won’t consider helping in any way because their policy is that a complaint must be lodged within 5 days

I ordered an Echo Show from them on Wednesday 22 August, and it was delivered today, 27 August. Never received an order this quick from the US and their info on tracking an order is superior to any other Supplier. I will use Ubuy again.

Bought shoes on U-buy
Bought shoes on U-buy. They are very quick to deliver, but take no accountability afterwards. The shoes I ordered was a UK 6 and the shoes I got was equivalent to a UK 9. So wanted to swop for something else from them. They say they don’t take anything back. But the returns policy does not state that! Terrible!

So after my review they have sent me email after email to waste my time and to take no accountability. Please do not use them as their product is not according to world standards when it comes to shoes. Waste of a time company!

I ordered FBI Cards on Aug 7
I ordered FBI Cards on Aug 7, 2018, don't know when they will ship it because I need it before my Embassy visits us here in Hail, Saudi in August 17th or 18th.

Hope they could deliver it before that day. It's for my future.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The above statement was my first review. As a first time online shopper for this ubuy.com, I just wanted to make sure that my money i paid for the item would not just become wasted because I have read lots of negative comments on this site, but, they called me earlier and gave me an assurance that I would receive the item before Aug.16, 2018 and I am glad knowing it is really a trusted site. I don't know what happened to the other's comment, but in my own experience, I could guarantee that this site is legit.

I will update you all soon for the delivered item.
I'm still waiting.
______________________________________________
Today is the 6th day since I ordered from ubuy.com, and I am satisfied with their service. I just received my purchased item today through DHL. If only I could post my photo with the item, I would do it.

Thanks ubuy!

Hello Nick,

We apologise for the inconvenience caused to you and would like to inform you that our refunds usually take place on time but in your case, we received a chargeback request from PayPal just after 2-3 days of placing the order and that caused the delay in processing the refund since we can not process the refund from our side if any customer raised a chargeback request. In that case, one has to communicate with PayPal only regarding refund updates. Meanwhile, we got notified by PayPal that they have refunded you the amount.

Looking forward to serving you better in the future.

Thank you!

Actually everything is good except the total price especially in handling fee.. From my opinion is enough with shipping so far.. And one more thing about the warehouse sometimes it's not specific coz I ordered many times before and after my order within 3-4 days it's been replied to me that you're out of stock and it's for me frustrating and waisted my time.

Update: 30 May 2018 - Ubuy arranged for return pickup through DHL. They informed that the refund shall be processed once the item is returned to seller. Will update back once the amount is credited back to my account.

Hi

I received a defective item in my Order# 40518870714.
The item was received on 20 May 2018 and I raised my concern through Ubuy chat support on 21 May 2018 and have also sent email to Ubuy.

The sound is inaudible and very tinny. Please see the attached video to see the difference in audio levels between the received item and my laptop sound. It is very clear that I have received a defective unit.

Please arrange for a replacement at the earliest as this is supposed to be a gift for my son.

Order Date = 5/14/2018

Product Name = Nebula Capsule, Smart Portable Projector, Pocket Cinema with High-Contrast, Remarkable 100'' Picture, 360° Speaker, Android 7.1, 4 hour Video Playtime, 30 hour Music Playtime, Dedicated App and More.

SKU = ubuy_B076Q3GBJK

Price = QAR1,527.00
Prorated Shipping & Gateway + Customs fees = QAR 362

Waiting for your response.

Down a star as there could be a little more variety with each type of product. Generally only one kind of anything (I was looking for). Add more suppliers and this site will be 5 stars.

Mr Sidharth Kathpal , who goes to full extent of sincerity and total dedication .. he is very hard working and handles any issues excellently/effectively.. Ubuy is in safe hands here in India
Other Ubuy representatives are Mr Ruchier, Mr Sameer, Mr A Singh and others with whom i have very cordial discussions/correspondence and have been very effective / understanding.. Keep it up pl.
With these words, i just love to buy on Ubuy as i know my items are safe and guaranteed deliveries without any issues
I have already recommended Ubuy to my Relatives and Friends who may be interested in buying quality items with ease in India.
Suggestion : Please Include UPS as one of your shipping agent / courier as they are most efficient for extra cost of shipping.

Wasn't easy, but they did make it right.
Uses local internet addresses to give you the illusion that they are a local service, but sends electronics that don't work in your country. Not only that, the product came and didn't work even after I used converters and transformers. They should place pop-reminder for all purchases made of electronics that will come with different plugs.

It was a real challenge to get my money back, but in the end they came through. I was happy that they finally made it right.

Good sometimes, bad other times
This is my own feeling, but it seems ubuy just copies Amazon's inventory, adds a little bit of surcharge to it, and displays it as their own. Sometimes they list an item on "sale", whereas the sale price is higher than the amazon price.
Aside, I've bought from a couple of times. One went smoothly, the other was just awful. I bought three pairs of pants, and two arrived almost a month later, even though I paid for 5 day shipping. They lied about the pants "stuck in customs". And the day after I talked to them I got a message from DHL that they received the package.
Two months later and the last pair of pants had not arrived. Again I contact them, and they give me this story of the pants "lost in transit'. I requested a refund for the last pair, and the customer rep wouldn't answer my question on the customs and shipping I paid for the last pair.
Their customer service is really horrendous. If you buy from them you better pray nothing goes wrong or else you're in for a lot of trouble.

READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!
Read terms and conditions please. Say you bought the product and now you wait to receive. Now!! Here's the catch....what they do is if they run out of the original product you wanted they will swap it and send it to you without telling you. In my situation the product they sent me did not come near or look as close to the original. I was so furious and contacted the the next day, no email back or call it was so shocking dealing with these people, even the mangers shocking. call them numerous times (guys this is half the battle) it is so hard to contact them.

Dissatisfactory customer service
If I could I would give this company less than one star. I opted to have my order shipped with express shipping and I am now on my third week waiting for them to actually ship my order. When contacting the company by email they are at best unhelpful and at times unresponsive. When contacting the chat that is provided on their website you end up chatting to the same people that are unhelpful or unresponsive via email. It is basically a full-blown kafka´cian experience.

UPDATE: I ended up receiving my order after approximately a month. However, I never received an explanation nor did I receive a compensation for the fact that an Express order took a month to arrive. The only suggestion I can give is use this service if you have enough time to wait for your order. And save your breath. Contacting customer service seem to have little effect.

A sham and cheat. Avoid this seller at all cost.

I bought a few stuff but they were "unable to find my items" in their warehouse and took 6 months to get back to me.

They even flat out reject refunds and will drag until forever. Seems like their tactic is to charge your card and delay your items or disappear. Up to date I still have not received my items nor my refund. Should bring these scammers to the consumer tribunal!

In total I send so many photos n videos. All the video clearly shows the connection n proved that the converter which the staff suggest me to buy r not working, not comparable at all but they continue to request for more video to be send. They just do not want to resolved the problem.

I even send mails to escalate the matter to his founder Abdulwahab. He surprised me by keeping silence. Thus, I made a decision by throwing alway the staffs that I bought $400 plus. This is a very.Very bad experience hope u don't fellow my footsteps.

If I could have used no stars, I would have. This company eish- .za.com... already sounds like a scam. Anyway, they NEVER answer their phones! As far as I am concerned, people who can't face their customers- even over the phone- have something to hide. And don't even tell me about the Kuwait time difference.. I tried calling all hours of the day and night.

I ordered something they messaged me back that they were not able to send the items due to some customs issue. So i requested for refund..been more than 2 months now trying to contact them but they keep sayin their refund gateway has some issue then they said it got suspended and they will refund back via paypal. They didnt ofcourse, so i asked them to send it in credit form on my ubuy account. They confirmed that they will refund within 48 hrs..been 2 weeks now they still dint refund me back. BIG SCAM. Avoid this company at all cost.

They are scammers, They don't make complete delivery and they take your money! Even you do complain, they let you waisting your time by mails and calls, in the end, they will deny your request. Your are advised, do not make any transaction with UBUY, and normally Google web and store should ban this online web site UBUY.COM

Fake Product
I purchased a product from the US. It was Waterpik WP-100 water flosser.
The product I received was Waterpulse advantage, a lower quality brand. There was no invoice in it and I'm still trying to prove it. I feel like being frauded. I couldn't even sen the product back yet. It has been over a month.
I am really disappointed and angry.

Scammers
They are scammers. When I realised they wanted my passport and other confidential info in order to 'complete the order' I decided to cancel my order. They said they would refund me within 2 days. 2 months later still no refund. Their excuse is that their money refund transfer process is undergoing some kind of upgrade. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THESE PEOPLE. You will never see your order money or your money again.

Charge a fortune for delivery, provide no updates, you are unable to cancel the order without incurring the huge delivery costs even if it takes months.

Buyer Beware!
Horrible service.
I suspect that they are scammers who are involved in identity theft.

They will charge your credit card. Then they will demand that you provide them all kinds of personal information for "the bank" to protect you from "fraud".

They threaten that they will cancel your order if you do not comply. From what I read here, I'm sure you'd never receive your order anyway. I wish I came to this website before I placed my order.

I dont recommend it
I dont recommend it! waste of money and time. I received my order in two shipments, both are late but the second one was 2 weeks later than the first! The expiry date was 15 days from the date I received the shipment! customer service is so much robotic! you feel like they just repeat the same script with less things they can do for you! their 24/7 phone is mostly untended! their live chat is not really live and it's kind of useless! and at the end they don't bother to ask you about your experience as a new customer, even when approach them to share your experience (to check if they really want to serve you and retain you as a customer or just hit and run) you don't get response other than: "sorry we cannot anything for you!" and then stop responding to the chat!! so they don't even intend to improve!
After all I think that I should blame myself of wasting AED 900 ($250) as I didn't read reviews about Ubuy! I really dont recommend Ubuy to anyone!

I was very skeptical about buying from Ubuy and called before placing the order. The order was incorrect and I had to cancel it - the customer service was very helpful. Canceled and placed the second order.
Some additional paperwork was required and I called customer support again - I must say the help was very comforting. The person, Reshu made sure he spoke to local delivery and my elderly parents do not have to run around worrying about it. I really appreciate that.
I placed my order well ahead of time and even then the timeline was within the promised time.

It's an expensive option but I'm happy it's available to me.

Thank you Ubuy and keep up the good work!

Goods received after 19 days; when ubuy promised 5-9 business days
I bought two items worth USD1200 on 28 May. The ubuy site said shipment to reach 5-6 days. Site said shipment is from USA. Confirmation after purchase did not provide courier tracking number. I emailed them and only got the tracking number on 4 June. They kept saying tracking details will be provided after goods reach their warehouse by the seller. After several email exchange, ubuy finally provided me with an Aramex tracking number on day 7. When I emailed Aramex they said to check with ubuy as goods has not bee delivered to them. By which time, I became anxious. Only on day 9, Aramex site indicate goods are in transit. I finally received the goods on day 19. Fortunately the goods are what I had ordered. One of the boxes indicated an amazon.com Purchase Order #. Ubuy could really improve on their representations, if it really takes 19 days for goods to be delivered then just say so. It would save me unnecessary anxiety.

Either inept, uncaring or not to be trusted.
Either inept, uncaring or not to be trusted - I bought an item valued at over $300 with Ubuy, delivery don time no dramas, was very impressed, it is now that I am realising how lucky I was - in short, they are either inept, overwhelmed and working with antiquated systems or simply dishonest. I have tried to work with them to resolve a failed delivery issue, luckily I am only out $56 on this order, Ubuy don't seem to have any interest in resolving the issue - when you get to their site and initiate a "chat" Session - you get the same message every time - "There are 6 guests waiting" then you get a follow up message " all of our operators are busy please try again in a few minutes" then nothing - it seems that if you are lucky with your order all is OK, if anything goes wrong then you are on your own, they seem to have no interest or ability to resolve, in fact they don't even try and resolve the issues, tried to tell me that I w as not entitled to a refund also - left with no option other than to instruct my bank to claw back the funds.
First time I have ever had to ask my bank to remove funds from an online retailer - Ubuy just don't respond - no interest or ability to resolve this issue.

An update on this one, just had a mail from Ubuy, it seems the issue is my fault, I am the one who has let the side down - needless to say there have been no failed delivery attempts to my apartment and this is just another example of how not to handle an issue - often it is how a company resolves and fixes issues that can help it stand out, in this instance, Ubuy are most definitely standing out, just not in the gang you would feel safe trading with

If you ring their NZ contact number, it is deregistered. Google the address and it is a post office which scans back to head office in Kuwait.

Unlike Amazon, you can not return goods. Their goods are suited to some countries but may not be used or suitable for the NZ market.

Don’t support this company, I wish for no customer to be treated unfairly and with disrespect. They are extremely unprofessional and have hidden agendas to cripple the customer and basically once you paid them you can kiss goodbye to your cash!!
I don’t know how they can still run a scam such as this and claim that they successful, yes, most reviews are auto generated and false !!!!

I received a delivery in November goods damaged
I received a delivery in November of a Swan Retro Microwave in Orange from UBuy Dubai. Unfortunately, it was delivered with a large scratch across the silver door handle. I meant to call ask for it to be replaced and every time I look at it I think 'must remember to call UBUY'.

However never got around it but yesterday was reminded of this as I received a delivery from DesertCart of a Swan Orange Retro kettle and toaster in perfect condition. I contacted Ubuy to see if they could replace my microwave as I know it is under a manufacturer warranty for a year and they refused. Rahul was the person I chatted to. Very unhelpful.

DO NOT TRUST UBUY.
We bought 3 items, 2 were only supplied. UBUY's conditions stated that any goods not supplied will receive a refund. That never happened. When we opened a case with PayPal and provided UBUY's own documents and invoice to support our case, PayPal denied our claim for the missing item and screwed us big time. UBUY did nothing to defend themselves or provide hard evidence and we lost our claim.
Ubuy know all the tricks, excuses to pass any refund obligations and be able to charge more for less products shipped.
Robbed once by UBUY then again by PayPal.

Awful company. Good if youre in the middle east. Rubbish anywhere else. Im in Asia and spent 2 days on the phone to my bank to get a Visa card payment authorised. My bank authorised payment but Ubuy cancelled as I was asking for delivery to Asia and not the UK where my card was registered. Came up 'Failed transaction' on Ubuy website BUT THE MONEY WAS STILL DEBITED from my account. I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and my bank said 'they can still take the money for an indefinite period....we have to honour visa payments'. The shipping costs were nearly a quarter of the total payment as well. AVOID THIS COMPANY

No trust. orst experience ever
No trust. Worst experience ever. Borderline robbery. I order a product from their UAE site where I registered. They automatically defaulted to the US site without notice. They shipped a product with a 115Volt power. They never mentioned anywhere that the product had 115V power. Now they refuse toe exchange the product. Beside being 4 days late. Amazon would even refund this no questions asked. Do not buy at Ubuy. Save your self the agony.

DECEIVING PRICE, TERRIBLE SERVICE, be really careful.
you will be cheated by this website.

I bought one pack of Tassimo Jacobs Caff serveral weeks ago. i live in Belgium now?i tried to buy it through amzon.de, but self-opretated product by amzon.de can not be delivered to Belgium, i have to pay the delivery fees if i bought it from individual seller. I thought maybe there are some cheaper online shop.

So i searched for "coffe be", then the ubuy.be jumped out, i thought it is a professional online shpping website for Belgians (forgive me, i am not locals, i am not familar with online shopping here in Belgium) the price showed on the website is really cheap, 13 to 18 euros. BUT IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE. If you proceed to pay, you will have two options, for example, the 13 euro coffee, with the express delivery, you need to pay 25.20 euro, normal delivery 17.10, that is still acceptable. BUT IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE. if you continue the payment, you will find you lost more than 40 euros!!!

After i checked my bank account, i found it was deducted more than 40 euros, then i contacted with the official email address. i really want to use bad language here!!!! i sent them aroung 10 emails asked them to cancel my order, they just told you please wait, please wait, they did not do anything. i still have all the documents with me.

I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, BE CAREFUL WITH PRICE, IT IS NOT THE FINAL PRICE, AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL IF YOU HAVE PAID. BE CAREFUL!! DECEIVING WEBSITE! IF YOU DO NOT PAY ATTENTION, YOU WLL NEVER NOTICE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE PAID!!!!
